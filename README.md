# Credit Card Users Churn Prediction

## Overview
This repository hosts the **Credit Card Users Churn Prediction** project, completed as part of the Data Science and Machine Learning course by Great Learning in collaboration with UT Austin. The primary goal is to develop a predictive model to help Thera Bank identify customers likely to stop using their credit card services.

## Business Context
Thera Bank has experienced a significant decline in credit card usage, impacting its revenue derived from various fees such as annual fees, balance transfers, cash advances, late payments, and foreign transactions. To prevent customer attrition, Thera Bank seeks to identify potential churners proactively and improve services based on the findings.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project include:
- Developing a classification model to accurately predict customers who might churn.
- Identifying key factors that influence customer attrition.
- Suggesting actionable insights for the bank to enhance customer retention.

## Data Description
The dataset comprises customer account details with the following attributes:

| `Card_Category`            | Type of credit card held by the customer                        |
| `Months_on_book`           | Duration of the customerâ€™s relationship with the bank (months)  |
| `Total_Relationship_Count` | Number of products held by the customer                         |
| `Months_Inactive_12_mon`   | Months of inactivity in the past year                           |
| `Contacts_Count_12_mon`    | Number of contacts initiated by the customer in the past year   |
| `Credit_Limit`             | Credit limit on the card                                        |
| `Total_Revolving_Bal`      | Total revolving balance on the credit card                      |
| `Avg_Open_To_Buy`          | Average available credit over the past 12 months                |
| `Total_Amt_Chng_Q4_Q1`     | Change in transaction amount from Q4 to Q1                      |
| `Total_Trans_Amt`          | Total transaction amount over the past year                     |
| `Total_Trans_Ct`           | Total transaction count over the past year                      |
| `Total_Ct_Chng_Q4_Q1`      | Change in transaction count from Q4 to Q1                       |
| `Avg_Utilization_Ratio`    | Average credit utilization ratio                                |

**Key relationships:**
- **Revolving Balance:** Unpaid credit balance carried forward each month.
- **Average Open To Buy:** Average available credit limit over the past year.
- **Utilization Ratio Relationship:**
  \[(Avg_Open_To_Buy / Credit_Limit) + Avg_Utilization_Ratio = 1\]
